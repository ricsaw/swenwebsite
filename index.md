# About Myself
Howdy, I am Richard Sawh and I'm from Englewood New Jersey. I went to the Academies @ Englewood High-school and I was in the Information Systems program there. Some of my hobbies include working on cars, listening to music, programming random stuff, sleeping/not sleeping (sometimes), playing video games, boxing, cooking, and going to the gym. My favorite foods are any type of curry, dahl, roti, pizza, and fries. My favorite beverages are water and more water. The type of music that I listen to is quite diverse, it ranges from playboy carti to some old school reggae like Buju Banton and so on.
